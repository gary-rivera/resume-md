## Experience

### Senior Full Stack Engineer @ Orchard

_February 2024 - September 2024_

- Contributed to the full-stack integration of shipping Extra Card's credit tracking platform into Orchard’s platform, enhancing customer credit score qualification spanning all web app applications, and backend systems, which facilitated a streamlined pipeline for mortgage user acquisition.

- Supervised the development and fine-tuning of an automated user churn management system as both a cron job and an endpoint controller, reducing Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) by 8% through automated deactivation of delinquent users.

- Improved platform stability by implementing A/B testing and comprehensive end-to-end testing suites across all related web technologies and backend services, resulting in a 215% increase in test coverage (from 17% to 54%).

### Senior Full Stack Engineer @ Extra Card

_September 2022 - February 2024, remote_

- Led internal tooling performance optimization by leveraging SWR caching, request deduplication, background revalidation, enabling real-time updates, ultimately reducing API transactional overhead by 27% while remaining mindful of retaining intuitive UI/UX.

- Engineered a middleware-based permissions framework giving developer team granular control over API actions, decreasing authorization incidents by over 80% and preventing unauthorized access to critical actions, while enabling adaptive UI control throughout all platforms.

- Devised a bench-marker utility to track execution times of platform components, optimizing evaluation processes and reducing inefficiencies in asynchronous workflows through precise performance measurement.

- Architected a policy agreement module using design patterns that simplified access to policy data, resolved compliance issues, and improved maintainability for cross-team collaboration.

### Senior Full Stack Engineer @ Extra Card

_September 2021 - August 2022, remote_

- Optimized SQL queries by implementing advanced indexing strategies on key database tables, reducing execution times by up to 70% on datasets over 800,000 records and enhancing data retrieval for 100,000 users.

- Built an end to end feature to track user progress in the card journey, improving conversion rates by 12% month-over-month and reducing support inquiries by integrating real-time insights into KYC, agreements, bank linking, and card activation.

- Developed an automated CCPA-compliant data erasure tool to securely scrub PII across all databases and caches, fully eliminating the need for manual intervention by 100%, ensuring compliance, and maintaining an auditable history for regulatory oversight.

- Generated a unified Feed endpoint consolidating multiple services into a single call, eliminating redundant API requests. This optimization improved app load time by 36%, reducing startup time by 3 seconds and enhancing user experience.
